// {"Intuition
// The question stated some key things, my initial thoughts were:
// Non-empty array of integers, -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4, therefore numbers can be negative.
// Every number appears 2 times, except one number. Maybe this piece of info has the key?
// Time Complexity must be O(N).
// Space Complexity must be O(1).
// Therefore, Brute force solution (time complexity -> O(n^2)). Maps (space complexity -> O(n)) won't cut it.
// However, there must be something I can use to 'memorize' or 'remember' where each element is, or else, how will I identify/track my count of numbers.
// Approach
// I'm not gonna lie, the only reason I knew how to do this was because I read a similar solution before. The answer was using a bit manipulation of the numbers.
// On a high level we can think of bits or bitmasks as able to "store/remember" information using the position of the bits.
// In this case whenever 2 same numbers are XOR'ed with each other, they cancel out to form 0, on the other hand if 0 and any number are XOR'ed the output is the number itself. So,
// 7^7 = 0, simple?
// 7^7^7 = what will this be? Well XOR's are associative so let's break it down.
// 7^7 will be 0
// 111 (7)
// 111 (7)
// ^__
// 000 (0)
// so now it's 0 ^ 7, which is
// 000 (0)
// 111 (7)
// ^__
// 111 (7)
// So therefore 7^7^7 = 7, similarly 1^1^2 = 2,
// 4^1^2^1^2 = will be what?
// In this case, the 1's and 2's cancel out and we're left with 4^0 = 4, which is the only number with 1 occurrence and our answer in this case.
// Complexity
// Time complexity: O(n), we're iterating through the array once.
// Space complexity: O(1), no extra space is used, we're using the initial bitmask which is 0 and using XORs with the subsequent numbers/calculations.
// Code
// To anyone who doesn't understand this code(JavaScript) when we use the reduce method of an array we pass a function(callback) to it, as the 1st argument and an accumulator as the 2nd argument(in this case 0).
// Inside the callback, the first argument being passed is the accumulator and in the first iteration this will be 0 that we passed to reduce, for all subsequent iterations it will be the value passed by the callback function. The function is called for each element of the array and we also get the previous return value as prev to the function.
// So, for nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The function will calculate 0^4^1^2^1^2.
function singleNumber2(nums) {
    return nums.reduce(function (prev, val) { return prev ^ val; }, 0);
}
console.log(singleNumber2([5, 1, 5, 1, 3]));
